# MyPong

Hi, this is my implementation of the legendary Pong using the Java API!

Fell free to fork it and to whatever you want with it. The main method is in the "Pong.java" file.

About:

It uses a never-ending Thread calculating the delta time between the main loop calls. This value gets passed to the Pong game which will then eventually update the bats, ball and the score.
